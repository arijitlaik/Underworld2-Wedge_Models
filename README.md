# Underworld2-Wedge_Models

Models(Geometry, boundary contions and material) are based on Ruh et al. 2013 High-resolution 3D numerical modeling of thrust
wedges: Influence of d√©collement strength on transfer zones, implemented in [UWGeodynamics](https://github.com/rbeucher/UWGeodynamics), a module for [Underworld2](https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld2)

### Image with Smoothing Topograpy with Savitzky-Golay filter of window size 3 and degree 1(large dt for topo)
